🧸 Plush Store
[🔗 Live Demo
](https://zagorodniuchka.github.io/tum-web-lab2/)

Handmade crochet plushies made with love — since 2020.

Plush Store is my personal project and a small handmade business I started back in 2020. It all began with a love for crocheting and one fluffy bunny — and grew into an Instagram-based shop for custom plushies. Everything is 100% handmade, one stitch at a time. 🧶💕

This landing page is a minimal web presence for the store. It includes:

🎨 A clean, responsive design

🛍️ A small product showcase

🧵 An "About" section with a focus on craft and care

📩 Contact section and a link to our Instagram
